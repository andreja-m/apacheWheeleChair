# apacheWheeleChair

apacheWheeleChair is simple script that help with seting up and configuring apache web server (as you could't guess)
not doing much for now, just saving a lot of time that i wold use to type systemctl commands...

installation part in script is in my oppinion necessary so you can access script for any directory 
just by typing awc in terminal
