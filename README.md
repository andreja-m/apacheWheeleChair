# apacheWheeleChair

apacheWheeleChair is simple script that help with seting up and configuring apache web server (as you could't guess)
not doing much for now, just saving a lot of time that i wold use to type systemctl commands...

installation part in script is in my oppinion necessary so you can access script for any directory 
just by typing awc in terminal

plan is also to add redhat version becous this one use apache2 instead of redhats httpd
